  <h3><a nam="1933LongBeach">The 1933 Long Beach Earthquake</a></h3>
  <p>The 1933 Long Beach earthquake occurred on March 10th at 5:54 p.m. Pacific Time. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake, this relatively weak shake destroyed many shoddy buildings with weak structures. This earthquake caused ~$50 million in damages and 120 deaths. Seventy schools around Long Beach were destroyed within a few seconds of the shake. Were this to happen during school time, the number of deaths may have risen to the thousands. It is interesting to note that schools with reinforced concrete were not damaged.</p>
  <p>The destruction of Long Beach led to the Field Act, as well as the Uniform Building Code of 1935. The Field Act was enacted exactly one month after the earthquake. The Field Act required new building to be designed to state standards by certified designers. The Field Act, however, did not fix buildings from pre-1933. The Garrison Act of 1939 fortunately, required pre-1933 buildings to be retrofitted with the latest earthquake safety system. Since then, earthquakes have never damaged Field Act schools.</p>

  <h3><a name="1994Northridge">The 1994 Northridge Earthquake</a></h3>
  <p>The Northridge earthquake struck at 4:30:55 A.M., on January 17th, 1994. The 6.7 earthquake did not have a “strong” magnitude, and did not last long (~15 sec). Nevertheless, about 60 people died, and property damage totaled to more than $20 billion. Most of the damage occurred in parking structures and freeways. This, in turn, caused landslides in mountain areas – such as the Santa Monica Mountains. This was the most costly earthquake in U.S. history. However, this gave us new insights necessary in order to make new advancements in earthquake safety.</p>
  <p>The earthquake sparked the creation of the California Earthquake Authority. This organization offers residents earthquake insurance after some insurance companies did not give any money to earthquake victims. The organization is privately funded, while the public manages it. Los Angeles has since become stricter in handling design reviews of buildings, which has basically improved every aspect of earthquake safety since the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The question is, are these steps big enough to withstand “the Big One”?</p>

  <p>Kits can vary in price, number of people it can sustain, supplies, durability, and size.  These kits may contain basic survival necessities such as water and food to more duplex survival goods such as sleeping bags and raingear.  However, what matters most is that you have a kit that suits your needs and that each individual in your family has their own. </p>

  <h4>Why a Backpack?</h4>
  <p>With your survival supplies stored in a bag, it does not only hold all of you’re emergency supplies but it is portable and offers pockets for storage of personal items such wallets, entertainment items, water bottles, and cell phones. It is important to keep supplies in an easy to carry bag or type luggage either in an easy accessible place at home take with you in case of a natural disaster. </p>


<h3><a name="future">A Statistical Future</a></h3>
<p>For people in California, they are all waiting for the “big one.” However, they must not only wait for this inevitable natural disaster – they must prepare for it.</p>
<p>In 2007, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake rocked Chile, resulting in only a surprisingly low number of fatalities, which were 521. To learn how Chile suffered such a low number of fatalities, the American Red Cross of Los Angeles and San Francisco sent earthquake experts to find the reasons why. They hoped to learn from Chile’s preparation and response so that they can instruct Californians in how to prepare for future earthquakes, especially the “big one.”</p>
<p>One lesson learned, and probably the most important, is that there is a Chilean law that holds building owners responsible for any damage 10 years after construction, even if ownership changes. So, building owners in Chile are more apt to construct buildings that are more earthquake-resistant. Building owners in California, who do not have to adhere to this law, are less apt to construct buildings that are earthquake-resistant – probably due to saving money.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned is that buildings in California are based on building codes from the early 20th century. In order to withstand earthquakes today, those buildings should be built based on building codes today. Also, Californians must be knowledgeable in what to do during an earthquake. For the earthquake in Chile, Chileans knew that they should go to higher ground. That fact probably saved numerous Chileans’ lives.</p>
<p>Lessons were also learned from Japan, which suffered a devastating magnitude 9.0 earthquake. In Japan, there are automated seismic recording systems that, through television and cell phones, warn people if an earthquake will occur. Actually, it warned people more than half a minute before strong shaking occurred.
All activities were halted, such as surgeries and manufacturing. Elevators, even, stopped to the nearest floor and let people exit. 
Here, in California, the California Integrated Seismic Network is trying to develop a system similar to the one implimented in Japan, but lacks funding required in order to make any serious attempt.
So, these lessons learned should be valuable to us. We must learn them in order to prepare for the “big one.” We really need to.</p>
