<h3><a name="suburbanization">Suburbanization</a></h3>
<p>Suburbanization describes the general trend of city dwellers moving from the city into residential areas in ever-growing concentric circles away from the city's core. The transition from urban living to suburban living was due to many push and pull factors. Problems arose in urban living, pushing people away from urban cities. Meanwhile, new technological advances and economic stability pulled people into suburban living.</p>

<p>The push factor of urban living was due to crowdedness, pollution, costliness, unsanitary conditions, and racial discrimination. With new technological advances that made farming easier, the need for farmers decreased. This led to a massive migration of people into urban cities, looking for jobs. However as people kept migrating, the cities became denser and denser; landlords crammed as many people as possible into buildings. Often a room, meant for one family, was shared by four. The local government quickly became unable to match the pace of growth within cities, which meant they were unable to extend clean water, garbage collection, and sewage systems to various parts of the city. Cities were also mostly concentrated in industries that emitted air pollutants. This made the air in cities hazardous. The cost of renting in a city was also more expensive than the cost of buying a house in the suburbs. William Levitt and Henry Kaiser took advantage of this. They used assembly-line methods to mass produce houses in the suburbs. These push factors contributed to the migration from urban cites to the suburbs.  This migration was also named the “White Flight” because the majority of people migrating were the white middle class. As the cities became more populated with minorities, especially black minorities, the white middle class left in order to build and maintain more homogeneous communities in the suburbs.</p>
