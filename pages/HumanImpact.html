  <h3>What is geothermal energy?</h3>
<p>Geothermal energy is the energy that exists deep inside the earth’s core. We obtain the energy through multiple methods. Some of which include dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle. Dry steam and flash steam methods are similar because they both incorporate the high temperatures of the steam to generate power for the turbine/generator units to produce electricity. While on the other hand the binary cycle the steam from the geothermal reservoir does not come in contact with the turbine/generator units. The binary cycle heats another working fluid which then is vaporized and helps the turbine/generator units to function. </p>

<h3>Alternative Energy</h3>
<p>Geothermal energy is the energy that exists deep inside the earth’s core. We obtain the energy through multiple methods. Some of which include dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle. Solar energy is the heat obtained from the sun to energy. One of the most reasonable methods of obtaining the energy is through solar panels.</p>
