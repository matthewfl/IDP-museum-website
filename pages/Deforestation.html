  <p>Logging</p>
  <p>Another huge cause of deforestation is logging, both illegal and legal.  Logging supplies the world with wood and paper products, but it also cuts down an enormous number of trees each year.  Those who illegally log cause even more damage; by bypassing the law, there is no limit to their logging.	In the past, especially during the gold rush, Californians have believed that timber was an “inexhaustible” resource, and carelessly and recklessly cut down timber without realizing the consequences.</p>

  <p>In 1973, the Forest Practice Act was established, ensuring that logging will be conducted in such a way that minimal environmental harm will be done.	 Nowadays, the state government has enforced regulations for cutting timber, protecting certain species of plants and limiting the amount that can be cut.  THPs, or Timber Harvesting Plans, are to be submitted before operations can be carried.  Annually, 2 billion feet of board are harvested while 3.8 billion are grown.</p>

  <h3>Governmental Solutions</h3>
  <p>California has been involved in the reduction and prevention of deforestation and habitat loss as well as the conservation of wildlife fauna/flora.  State agencies such as the Department of Fish and Game and the Department of Forestry & Fire Protection commit to protecting the environment and enforcing the law.</p>
  <p>The Department of Fish and Game’s mission statement is to “manage California's diverse fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological values and for their use and enjoyment by the public.”  They have passed acts and plans such as the Invasive Species Program, whose goal is to reduce the negative effects of invasive species (non-native to the state and they wreak havoc to the state’s economy and environment) that threaten the survival of native species, and California Endangered Species Act (CESA), which states that “all native species of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, invertebrates, and plants, and their habitats, threatened with extinction and those experiencing a significant decline which, if not halted, would lead to a threatened or endangered designation, will be protected or preserved.”</p>
  <p>The Department of Forestry & Fire Protection’s mission is to protect and sustain the natural resources in California.	 There are 85 million acres in California classified as wildlands, and 17 million are classified under forest land.  The Department has been active in countering deforestation, limiting the amount of timber that can be harvested.  CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) forces state and local agencies to identify the environmental impacts of their actions before carrying them out and the Forest Practice Act sets guidelines for foresters and timber operators so that wildlife will be minimally impacted under restricted logging.</p>
  <p>Other solutions for deforestation and the loss of wildlife species include the increase of public awareness.	As more people become more aware, they will become more involved in protecting the fragile environment we live in.</p>
